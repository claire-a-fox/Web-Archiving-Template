## Web Archiving Template
The practice of web archiving can be disorienting, with ever-shifting contexts and understandings of where to find basic identification information. With that in mind, this repository aims to provide a basic template for novice web archivists to identify key metadata at a fixed point in time while attempting to capture current and inactive websites. This template will hopefully provide an anchor for those new to the practice who are attempting to determine what information is important to the long-term preservation of inherently ephemeral and intangible online creations.
## User story
_As an archival intern who wants to capture websites that are part of a large collaborative project, I want to create a guide that standardizes basic metadata for small-scale website captures, so I can complete my work efficiently and then successfully hand off the project to the incoming intern._
## Criteria for Success
  * Create template draft
  * Collaborate with other interns to distill newcomers' experience with web archiving
  * Create a template and upload to github as a PDF and .docx
  * Create lightweight website
