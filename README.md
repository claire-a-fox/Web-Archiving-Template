[Web Archiving Template](https://github.com/claire-a-fox/Web-Archiving-Template/blob/master/20181210_template.docx)
## Summary
The process of building human-scale web archives can be disorienting. Websites live in many different ecosystems, sometimes even within themselves. In an online context, which metadata fields become important to record? This repository aims to provide a high-level template to gather information about websites, the process of capturing them, and their native context.  It is specifically aimed toward archiving net art exhibitions. These exhibitions are in various states of current, inactive, or passively ongoing. This template provides an anchor for documenting these exhibitions, by identifying CollectiveAccess-oriented metadata about them that will be useful for future archivists, researchers, and other web enthusiasts.
## User story
_As an archival intern who wants to capture websites that are part of a large collaborative project, I want to create a guide that standardizes basic metadata for human-scale website captures, so I can complete my work efficiently and then successfully hand off the project to the incoming intern._
## Criteria for Success
  * Create template draft
  * Collaborate with other interns to distill newcomers' experience with web archiving
  * Create a template and upload to github as a .docx
  * Create lightweight website
