## Web Archiving Template
The process of building a human-scale web archive can be disorienting. Websites live in many different ecosystems, sometimes even within themselves. Basic information can be difficult to discern. This repository aims to provide a basic template to gather information about websites and the process of capturing them.  It is specifically aimed toward the archiving of online art exhibitions. These exhibitions are in various states of current, inactive, or passively ongoing. This template provides an anchor for documenting these exhibitions, by identifying basic metadata about them that will be useful for future archivists, researchers, and other web enthusiasts.
## User story
_As an archival intern who wants to capture websites that are part of a large collaborative project, I want to create a guide that standardizes basic metadata for human-scale website captures, so I can complete my work efficiently and then successfully hand off the project to the incoming intern._
## Criteria for Success
  * Create template draft
  * Collaborate with other interns to distill newcomers' experience with web archiving
  * Create a template and upload to github as a PDF and .docx
  * Create lightweight website
