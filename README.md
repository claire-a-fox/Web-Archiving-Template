This repository will provide documentation about web documentation
## User story
_As an archival intern who wants to capture websites that are part of a large collaborative project, I want to create a guide that standardizes documentation for small-scale website captures, so I can complete my work efficiently and then seamlessly hand off the project to the incoming intern._
