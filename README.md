# Web-Archiving-Template
This repository aims to provide a basic documentation template for budding web archivists who are attempting to capture websites new and old. The practice of web archiving can be disorienting, with ever-shifting contexts and understandings of where to find basic identification information. This template will hopefully provide an anchor for those new to the practice who are attempting to determine what information is important to the long-term preservation of an ephemeral and intangible online creation.
## User story
_As an archival intern who wants to capture websites that are part of a large collaborative project, I want to create a guide that standardizes documentation for small-scale website captures, so I can complete my work efficiently and then seamlessly hand off the project to the incoming intern._
